### 5. **SALES FORM**

This sheet allows the user to **input new sales data** directly and dynamically into the system.

#### üßæ How it works:

- You **fill out** fields like: `Customer Name`, `Product`, `Category`, `Date`, `Quantity`, `Unit Price`, etc.
- After entering the data, you **click the `Submit` button**.
- A macro runs to **automatically transfer the data** into the main **Retail Store Sales** sheet.
- Once submitted:
  - The form **clears itself** (data is erased for next entry).
  - All calculations (Total Cost, Revenue, Net Profit) and dashboard values **update automatically**.
- You can modify or extend the VBA macro logic to suit your business rules.

üìå **Note:** Make sure to enable macros for the submit functionality to work properly.
